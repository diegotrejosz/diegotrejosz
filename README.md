## Hey there, I'm Diego 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on: data-driven environmental projects focused on water treatment, waste management, and process optimization.

🌱 I’m currently learning: advanced machine learning techniques, cloud analytics, and environmental monitoring tools.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: data science projects related to sustainability, industrial processes, and environmental engineering.

🤔 I’m looking for help with: deploying ML models in cloud environments and improving my big data workflow skills.

💬 Ask me about: chemical processes, water and wastewater treatment, data analysis (Python, SQL), and environmental engineering.

📫 How to reach me: diegotrejos.z@gmail.com

⚡ Fun fact: I’m a huge Star Wars fan and an astronomy lover — always curious about the universe on both the micro and macro scale.
